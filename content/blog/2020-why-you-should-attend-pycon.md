Summary: It's an Amazing conference



PyCon India is the largest gathering of Pythonistas in India for the Python programming language. The 12th edition of PyCon India will be taking place online from 2nd October to 5th October 2020.

In the 12 years of pycone this is probably the first year the conference is being held virtually but with our amazing team of volunteers and sponsors we assure that its going to be as amazing as ever.

First up lets talk about whats on the Agenda for the event -:

## Keynotes 
With 6 Amazing keynote speakers this year you are definitely going to have a lot of fun and learn some more at pycon India 2020. 
From Dontusethiscode to a core cpython developer, we have got it all  
 
## Devsprints
PyCon India is a place for developers from across the country (and beyond) to get together and celebrate Python. But what good is a PyCon without getting your hands dirty writing some code? Hence, for all Open Source enthusiasts out there, the PyCon India team is happy to announce Devsprints @Pycon2020

## Workshops
Workshops are an important part of the PyCon India. Hands on learning is as important as talks for a fulfilling conference experience. Like talks, workshops are also conducted by the members of the Python community.


## Networking at its best 
As mentioned before as well Pycon India attracts a bunch of people from Students to working professionals to hiring managers. You get to meet a whole bunch of new people and make new friends, see faces behind IRC nicks and in one case of one my friends actually meet the mantainer of an open source project you contribute to.
There are also a whole bunch of stalls wherein companies who are actually open to hiring are present and all thanks to our [virtual Platform](https://www.hopin.to), you could interact with them very easily and smoothly 
For students it presents an amazing opportunity to meet new people who have the same interests as you, spend the entire conference with them and finally make lifelong friends here.


## The cheapest tickets so far 
This time @pycon you get the cheapest tickets which includes 4 tracks of conference , 30+ talks, 6 keynotes and anyone can join devsprints.

# Community Building
Communities are made, revived and relived in these 4 exhilarating days. 
A lot of people meet lifelong friends who go on to start huge communities revolving around python development and related things here.
You will also get an opportunity to meet people representing amazing open source projects and communities here and you can network and actually start working with them right away.


## Conclusion
In conclusion,attending Pycon India is a pretty amazing experience and is even more fun since this year you would not have to travel and can do it within the comfort of your phone
